//This is a comment, duh.
import UIKit

//Comamnd + / to comment out multiple lines of code.
//Repeat that keybind again and it uncomments said lines.

//Swift doesn't have semicolons D: 
//Multiple statements can be on the same line, so you do:
var accountBalance = -500.0; var newBalance = 50 //Nobody really does this.

//You'll use semicolons in For loops but that's about it.
//Swift is a very...interesting language w/ loops especially.

for var x = 0; x < 50; x++ {
    print("Hi!")
}
